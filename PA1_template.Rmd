## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Loading and preprocessing the data
1. data will be read from D:/RProjects/Module5Study/Assignment1/activity.csv

```{r readData}
library(data.table)
setwd("D:/RProjects/Module5Study/Assignment1/")
activity <- data.table(read.csv("activity.csv"))

```

2a. transform date as character class into Date as Date class

```{r transform1}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
str(activity)
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r aggregate2a}
stepByDate <- activity[,sum(steps),by=date]
```

2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r plotHistogram}
hist(stepByDate$V1,col = "red",main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day",xlab="Total number of steps by day", ylab="Frequency by Day")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r calculate3}
mean <- mean(stepByDate$V1,na.rm = T)
median <- median(stepByDate$V1,na.rm = T)
cat(paste("The Mean and median number of steps taken each day are ", 
          mean, " and ", median, " respectively."))
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r timeSeriesPlot}
avrstepByInterval <- activity[,mean(steps,na.rm = T),by=interval]
plot(avrstepByInterval$interval,avrstepByInterval$V1,ylab='the average number of steps taken', xlab='', type='l', main = "Time series plot of the average number of steps taken by interval")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r cal2}
maxStep <- avrstepByInterval[which.max(avrstepByInterval$V1)]$interval
cat(paste("the maximum number of steps Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset is ",maxStep,"."))
```

##Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r calculate1}
incompleteR = nrow(activity[complete.cases(activity) == F,])
cat(paste("the total number of missing values in the dataset is ",incompleteR,"."))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r imputingValue}
avrstepByInterval <- activity[,mean(steps,na.rm = T),by=interval]
```
we will use the mean for that 5-minute interval to fiil in the missing values in the dataset.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r newDataSet}

newActivity <- merge(activity, avrstepByInterval, by = c("interval"),sort = F)
newActivity$steps[is.na(newActivity$steps)] <- newActivity$V1
incompleteR = nrow(newActivity[complete.cases(newActivity) == F,])
cat(paste("the total number of missing values in the dataset after impution is ",incompleteR,"."))
```

4a. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r aggregate2a1}
stepByDate <- newActivity[,sum(steps),by=date]
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r plotHistogram1}
hist(stepByDate$V1,col = "red",main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after impution",xlab="Total number of steps by day", ylab="Frequency by Day")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r calculate31}
mean <- mean(stepByDate$V1,na.rm = T)
median <- median(stepByDate$V1,na.rm = T)
cat(paste("The Mean and median number of steps taken each day after impution are ", mean, " and ", median, " respectively."))
```

4b. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
Based on the histogram, the data are extended vertically.

4c. What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
Based on the histogram, the median are skwed toward mean.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r dayofweek}
newActivity$dayofweek <- weekdays(newActivity$date)
newActivity$dayofweek[newActivity$dayofweek == "Saturday" | newActivity$dayofweek == "Sunday"] <- "weekend"
newActivity$dayofweek[newActivity$dayofweek != "weekend"] <- "weekday"
newActivity$dayofweek <- as.factor(newActivity$dayofweek)

str(newActivity)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r weekdayorendPlotSeries}
avrstepByIntervalDayofweek <- newActivity[,mean(steps,na.rm = T),by=list(interval,dayofweek)]
plot(avrstepByInterval$interval,avrstepByInterval$V1,ylab='the average number of steps taken', xlab='', type='l', main = "Time series plot of the average number of steps taken by interval")

library(lattice)
xyplot(V1 ~ interval | dayofweek, data = avrstepByIntervalDayofweek, type = "l", lwd = 2, layout = c(1, 2), ylab = "Number of steps")
```
